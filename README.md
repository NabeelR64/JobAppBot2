## Setup

### Prerequisites

| Dependency | Version | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|:--------|
| **Python** | 3.10+ | Backend runtime |
| **Node.js** | 18+ | Frontend tooling |
| **npm** | 9+ | Frontend package manager |
| **Angular CLI** | 18.x | `npm install -g @angular/cli` |
| **PostgreSQL** *(optional)* | 16+ | Production database (SQLite is used by default for local dev) |
| **Docker** *(optional)* | Latest | Required only if using PostgreSQL via `docker-compose` |

### Environment Variables

Before running, configure the backend `.env` file at `backend/.env`:

```env
# Required
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<your-google-client-id>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-google-client-secret>
SECRET_KEY=<your-jwt-secret-key>

# Optional — enable AI features
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
THEIRSTACK_API_KEY=<your-theirstack-api-key>

# Optional — switch to PostgreSQL (requires docker compose up -d)
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/jinder
```

> **Note:** Without `OPENAI_API_KEY`, resume embedding, cover letter generation, and Gmail email classification will use graceful fallbacks. Without `THEIRSTACK_API_KEY`, the job search API will not return real listings.

### Quick Start (One Command)

The easiest way to run both backend and frontend together:

```bash
chmod +x start_dev.sh
./start_dev.sh
```

This script will:
1. Create a Python virtual environment (if it doesn't exist)
2. Install backend dependencies
3. Start the FastAPI backend on `http://localhost:8000`
4. Install frontend dependencies
5. Start the Angular frontend on `http://localhost:4200`

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop all services.

### Manual Setup

#### Backend

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`. Interactive docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

#### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
ng serve
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:4200`.

### PostgreSQL Setup (Optional)

By default, Jinder uses SQLite for zero-config local development. To switch to PostgreSQL with pgvector support:

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL via Docker
docker compose up -d

# Then uncomment DATABASE_URL in backend/.env:
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/jinder
```

## Original Requirements & Analysis

You are a senior full-stack engineer and solution architect.
Your task is to design and implement an MVP for Jinder, a "Tinder for jobs" web application.

Jinder lets users:

- Sign in with Google
- Upload a resume
- Answer a few questions to build a profile
- Get suggested job categories and job listings
- Swipe left/right on job cards:
  - Left = skip
  - Right = auto-apply using browser automation and an AI-generated cover letter
- Track applications and statuses in a dashboard
- Allow the system to read their Gmail (read-only) to automatically detect updates (thank-you emails, interview invites, rejections, follow-ups, etc.).

Your output should be:

- A well-structured codebase
- Infrastructure setup notes (or IaC if possible)
- Clear documentation of APIs and flows

Focus on a working MVP first, but structure the code so premium features could be added later.

### 1. High-Level Requirements

#### User flow summary

1. **User signs in via Google Sign-In.**
2. **On first login, user is asked to:**
   - Upload one resume (PDF/DOCX). Only a single resume is supported in this MVP.
   - Answer profile questions: desired roles, locations, salary expectations, seniority, remote/on-site preference, etc.
3. System uses OpenAI embeddings to analyze the resume and build a semantic representation of the user's skills, experience, and education.
4. System recommends job categories/fields first (e.g., "Backend developer", "Data analyst", "Product manager") based on resume + profile.
5. **User can:**
   - Select categories they like.
   - Explicitly mark categories they don't want ("not interested in sales roles," etc.).
6. System pulls jobs from TheirStack API, ranks them using a hybrid scoring approach, and presents them as swipeable cards (desktop web).
7. User can filter jobs with a filter panel.
8. **For each job:**
   - Swipe left → skip.
   - Swipe right → automatically apply (no extra confirmation pop-up).
9. **System generates a tailored cover letter using LLMs based on:**
   - Job title
   - Job description
   - User's resume
   - User's profile preferences
10. System uses browser automation to fill application forms on the job's external site.
11. System records the application in the database.
12. **A dedicated dashboard page lets users see:**
    - Which jobs they've applied to
    - Statuses and a status timeline per job
13. **System requests read-only access to the user's Gmail and periodically:**
    - Reads new emails
    - Detects job-related messages (thank-you, interview invites, rejections, recruiter follow-ups, general status updates)
    - Updates the application status timeline accordingly
    - Sends notifications by email and SMS.

#### Non-goals (for MVP)

- No mobile-native app yet (later).
- No multi-resume support (MVP = single resume).
- No complex monetization or premium tiers in MVP.
- No support for non-Gmail providers in MVP.

### 2. Tech Stack Constraints

#### Frontend

- **Framework**: Angular (desktop-first design, but responsive enough).
- **Style**:
  - Color palette: sky blue, a complementary darker blue, and white as primary UI colors.
  - Clean, modern, card-based UI for job swiping.
- **Features**:
  - Google Sign-In button and flow integration.
  - Resume upload UI (drag-and-drop or simple file input).
  - Profile wizard (step-by-step).
  - Job browsing/swiping UI (Tinder-style deck).
  - Applied jobs dashboard and status timeline view.
  - Filter panel for:
    - Salary range
    - Remote/hybrid/on-site
    - Job title keywords
    - Seniority level
    - Company size
    - Location

#### Backend

- **Language**: Python.
- **Framework**: FastAPI.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (with SQLite fallback for local dev).
- **Email integration**: Gmail API with OAuth 2.0, read-only scope.
- **Resume and job embeddings**: OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`.
- **Job Source**: TheirStack API. Designed as a pluggable service.
- **Browser Automation**: Playwright (Python, headless Chromium).

### 3. Core Functional Components & APIs

Design the backend and API in a modular way. At a minimum implement:

#### 3.1 Authentication & Users

- Google OAuth sign-in.
- On first sign-in, create a user record in the database.
- Store user_id, email, and Google OAuth tokens/refresh tokens securely.

#### 3.2 User Profile & Resume

- Models: User, UserProfile, Resume.
- Endpoints: POST /resume/upload, GET /profile, PUT /profile.
- Behavior: On resume upload, store file, extract text, call OpenAI embeddings API, and store embedding vector.

#### 3.3 Job Categories & Recommendations

- Models: JobCategory, UserCategoryPreference.
- Endpoints: GET /jobs/categories/recommendations, POST /jobs/categories/preferences.
- Logic: Derive categories by matching resume embedding.

#### 3.4 Job Fetching & Matching

- Models: JobPosting, JobRecommendation.
- Logic (Hybrid scoring): Compute LLM/embedding similarity + rule-based constraints (skills, location, salary, etc.).
- Endpoints: GET /jobs/recommendations (paginated "deck" for swiping).

#### 3.5 Swiping & Applications

- Models: SwipeAction, Application, ApplicationStatusEvent.
- Endpoints:
  - POST /jobs/{job_id}/swipe (Payload: { "direction": "left" | "right" })
    - If right: Create SwipeAction, Create Application (PENDING_AUTOMATION), Trigger automation worker.
  - GET /applications (List of applications with status)
  - GET /applications/{id}/timeline (Status history)

#### 3.6 Cover Letter Generation

- Service that calls OpenAI model to generate a concise, professional cover letter based on resume, profile, and job details.

#### 3.7 Gmail Integration & Status Detection

- Background worker that polls Gmail using OAuth tokens.
- Detects job-related emails (sender, subject, LLM classification).
- Updates Application status and creates ApplicationStatusEvent.
- Sends notifications.

### 4. Frontend UX Requirements

- **Landing page**: Branding, tagline, "Sign in with Google".
- **Onboarding flow**: Sign-in, Resume upload, Profile questions, Gmail consent, Category selection.
- **Job browsing / swipe page**: Tinder-style card deck. Swipe controls. Filters panel.
- **Applications dashboard**: Kanban board with drag-and-drop status management. Detail view with timeline.
- **Settings / account page**: Update profile, reconnect Gmail, view resume.
- **Legal pages**: Privacy Policy, Terms of Use.

### 5. Security, Privacy, and Compliance

- HTTPS everywhere.
- Store PII and resume files securely (Encrypted S3, RDS).
- Secure secrets management.
- Role-based access (user can only see their own data).
- Read-only Gmail scopes.
- User mechanisms for revoking access and deleting account.

Added user dropdown in navbar. |
| 2026-02-13 | Phase 2 Roadmap | Added a comprehensive 3-week Phase 2 roadmap to `README.md` covering 6 goals: real resume parsing & AI cover letters, Playwright auto-apply, Kanban dashboard redesign, Gmail status tracking, daily swipe limits with analytics, and PostgreSQL migration with security hardening. |
| 2026-02-13 | Goal 1: Resume Parsing & Cover Letters | **Resume Parser**: Rewrote `resume_parser.py` with real PDF (PyPDF2) and DOCX (python-docx) text extraction. <br> **Cover Letter**: Rewrote `cover_letter.py` to generate tailored letters via OpenAI GPT-4o-mini with graceful fallback. <br> **Embeddings**: Created `embedding.py` service using OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` (1536-dim vectors stored as JSON in SQLite). <br> **Config**: Added `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL` settings; moved `THEIRSTACK_API_KEY` from hardcoded default to `.env`. |
| 2026-02-15 | Goal 3: Dashboard Redesign (Kanban Board) | **Kanban Board**: Replaced flat HTML table with a 5-column Kanban board (Pending, Applied, Interview, Offer/Other, Rejected) using Angular CDK `DragDropModule`. <br> **Drag-and-Drop**: Cards can be dragged between columns to update status via new `PATCH /applications/{id}/status` endpoint. <br> **ApplicationCardComponent**: New reusable card with company avatar, status badge, date, external link, and manual status dropdown. <br> **Filtering & Sorting**: Search by company/role and toggle sort (newest first vs. alphabetical). <br> **Backend**: Added PATCH endpoint with ownership validation and `ApplicationStatusEvent` audit trail. |
| 2026-02-15 | Goal 2: Browser Automation (Playwright) | **Automation Engine**: Rewrote `automation.py` with Playwright headless Chromium — navigates to job URLs, detects form fields, fills from user profile, uploads resume, captures screenshots. <br> **Form Detector**: Created `form_detector.py` with heuristic-based field detection (name, email, phone, resume upload, cover letter, LinkedIn, address) plus CAPTCHA and submit button detection. <br> **New Status**: Added `MANUAL_INTERVENTION_REQUIRED` to `ApplicationStatus` for CAPTCHAs, missing forms, and complex multi-step applications. <br> **Model Updates**: Added `screenshot_path` and `cover_letter_text` columns to `Application`. <br> **Dry Run Mode**: Default `DRY_RUN=True` fills forms without clicking Submit; set to `False` for production. <br> **Frontend**: Updated Kanban board and card component for new status with warning indicator and direct apply link. |
| 2026-02-15 | Goal 2 Enhancement: User Input for Unfillable Fields | **Pause & Resume**: When the bot encounters fields it can't fill (custom employer questions, missing profile data), it saves progress and pauses instead of giving up. <br> **New Status**: Added `USER_INPUT_NEEDED` to `ApplicationStatus` with `automation_state` JSON column storing filled fields, missing fields, and page URL. <br> **New Kanban Column**: "✍️ Needs Input" column shows applications awaiting user input. <br> **Inline Form**: Application cards show dynamically-rendered input fields for each missing field with labels and types, plus a "🚀 Resume Application" button. <br> **New API**: `POST /applications/{id}/provide-fields` accepts user-provided values and triggers `resume_automation()` as a BackgroundTask. <br> **Form Detector**: Added `get_all_visible_inputs()` to catch custom fields not matched by pattern detection. |
| 2026-02-17 | Goal 4: Gmail Integration for Status Tracking | **Gmail OAuth**: Server-side OAuth 2.0 flow for `gmail.readonly` scope with connect/callback/status/disconnect/poll endpoints. <br> **Gmail Service**: Full rewrite of `gmail.py` — `build_gmail_service()` (refresh token → client), `fetch_recent_emails()` (date-filtered search with recruiter domain + subject pattern filtering), `classify_email()` (GPT-4o-mini classification returning status/confidence/company_name), `match_to_application()` (fuzzy Jaccard company-name matching). <br> **Background Scheduler**: APScheduler `BackgroundScheduler` polls all Gmail-connected users every 15 minutes via `poll_all_users()`. <br> **Status Priority**: Won't downgrade statuses (e.g., won't go from INTERVIEW_INVITED back to APPLIED), only updates when confidence ≥ 0.7. <br> **Onboarding**: New Step 3 "Connect Gmail" with privacy note (read-only), connect/skip buttons. Profile view shows Gmail badge + disconnect option. <br> **Frontend**: New `GmailService` (connect, status, disconnect, poll). <br> **Model**: Added `gmail_refresh_token` and `gmail_connected_at` columns to `User`. |
| 2026-02-18 | Goal 6: PostgreSQL Migration & Production Hardening | **Docker Compose**: Created `docker-compose.yml` with PostgreSQL 16 + pgvector (deferred until Docker installed). <br> **Dockerfile**: Backend Dockerfile with Python 3.12, system deps, Playwright chromium. <br> **Config**: `DATABASE_URL` env var as primary DB override; SQLite fallback preserved; `RATE_LIMIT_GLOBAL` + `RATE_LIMIT_PER_USER` settings; removed `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`. <br> **Rate Limiting**: slowapi middleware — 30 req/min per-user (by IP), with `RateLimitExceeded` handler. <br> **File Validation**: Magic byte checks on resume uploads — verifies PDF (`%PDF`) and DOCX (`PK\x03\x04`) headers; rejects renamed files even if extension matches. <br> **Cosine-Similarity Ranking**: `rank_jobs_by_embedding()` using numpy — compares user's resume embedding against job description embeddings, returns jobs sorted by similarity. Works with both SQLite JSON and pgvector. <br> **Secrets Audit**: `.env` is sole source for all sensitive config; commented `DATABASE_URL` ready for Postgres switch. |
| 2026-02-24 | README Overhaul | Full restructure of `README.md`: moved Setup to top with prerequisites table, env var reference, and one-command quick start; updated Features to reflect all completed Phase 2 work; corrected Tech Stack to match actual dependencies (Angular 18, TheirStack, GPT-4o-mini, text-embedding-3-small); added Phase 2 progress overview table with completion statuses; condensed Frontend Development into a command table; trimmed Future Work to only remaining items; updated Original Requirements to reference TheirStack and Kanban dashboard. |
